metacharacters-

Regular expression - It is used to match the pattern from the given string.

\d - any digit from 0-9

. - can match any single character(letter,digit,whitespace..)

[abc] - will only match a single a, b, or c letter and nothing else

[^drp]an - match any three letter word ending with 'an' that does not start with 'd', 'r' or 'p'.

dash - to indicate character range.
Ex-1) [0-6] will only match any single digit character from zero to six, and nothing else.
2) [A-Za-z0-9_] - This can be donated as \w (word character)

{} - it is used in case of repititions of character.
Ex -1) a{3} will match the a character exactly three times.
2)  a{1,3} will match a charcter 1-3 times.

* - to match any number of times
Ex 1) \d* to match any number of digits.
2) \d+ which ensures that the input string has at least one digit.

Ex-  a+ (one or more a's), [abc]+ (one or more of any a, b, or c character).
2) .* (zero or more of any character).
3) aa+ - two or more a's.
4) d* - zero or more d's.

? - denotes optionality ( allows you to match either zero or one of the preceding character or group)
Ex 1) ab?c will match either the strings "abc" or "ac" because the b is considered optional.

Note -> dot and ? are special characters so we have to escape it using black slash to match the string.

\s - It will match any of the whitespaces(newline,tab,space..)
Ex - \s* - match white space for 0 or mre number of times.

Note 2) One way to tighten our patterns is to define a pattern that describes both the start and the end of the line using the special ^ (hat) and $ (dollar sign) metacharacters.
Ex- ^Mission:successfull$ - It will match only that string that starts with Mission and ends successfull.

() - To extract any group of characters.
Ex- ^(file.+)\.pdf$ - It will extract only characters within() parenthesis and which will start with file and end with pdf.
