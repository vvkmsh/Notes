metacharacters-

Regular expression - It is used to match the pattern from the given string.

\d - any digit from 0-9

. - can match any single character(letter,digit,whitespace..)

[abc] - will only match a single a, b, or c letter and nothing else

[^drp]an - match any three letter word ending with 'an' that does not start with 'd', 'r' or 'p'.

dash - to indicate character range.
Ex-1) [0-6] will only match any single digit character from zero to six, and nothing else.
2) [A-Za-z0-9_] - This can be donated as \w (word character)

{} - it is used in case of repititions of character.
Ex -1) a{3} will match the a character exactly three times.
2)  a{1,3} will match a charcter 1-3 times.

* - to match any number of times
Ex 1) \d* to match any number of digits.
2) \d+ which ensures that the input string has at least one digit.

Ex-  a+ (one or more a's), [abc]+ (one or more of any a, b, or c character).
2) .* (zero or more of any character).
3) aa+ - two or more a's.
4) d* - zero or more d's.

? - denotes optionality ( allows you to match either zero or one of the preceding character or group)
Ex 1) ab?c will match either the strings "abc" or "ac" because the b is considered optional.

Note -> dot and ? are special characters so we have to escape it using black slash to match the string.

\s - It will match any of the whitespaces(newline,tab,space..)
Ex - \s* - match white space for 0 or mre number of times.

Note 2) One way to tighten our patterns is to define a pattern that describes both the start and the end of the line using the special ^ (hat) and $ (dollar sign) metacharacters.
Ex- ^Mission:successfull$ - It will match only that string that starts with Mission and ends successfull.

() - To extract any group of characters.
Ex- ^(file.+)\.pdf$ - It will extract only characters within() parenthesis and which will start with file and end with pdf.

\\ - It is used to ignore \ and spaces.

/IC to ignore the case
/BIN to specify binary data
/DIG to interpret the pound sign (#) as a wildcard for a single digit
/ALNUM<case> to interpret the caret sign (^) as a wildcard for a single US–ASCII alphanumeric character.


Ex- When we have dynamic LB and RB.
OrderID1234=dynamicresponsedata1234
OrderID3456=dynamicresponsedata3456
OrderID8798=dynamicresponsedata8798

Soln- OrderID\d*=([a-z]*)\d*  - It will match only value specified between the brackets.(This is using Regex)
                                         or
web_reg_save_param(“Correlation_1”, “LB/DIG= OrderID####\=”, “RB=####”, LAST);

Ex - name="userSession" value="124027.388740381zDHQzfipiAiDDDDDDicHHpQfcif"/>\n<table border

Soln - \"userSession\"\\ value=\"(.*?)\"/>\\\n<table\\ border  - \\ is used to escape \ and space.
