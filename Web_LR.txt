load runner online questions

Load runner(HTTP) tutorials learn from Youtube videoes.
design studio for correlation
loadruuner while recording and replaying
once we creatre script autonaticaaly adds all files to script
we can edit the script by addind some step -design->inseert in script
step navigator - shows the entire vuser script in tabnular formnat.If we want to got to particular step of script just click on that partcilaur step and we will be there

Transactions-They are used to measure the time it takes to complete 1 or more actions of business process
merging graphs with correlate function - no of users vs res time then we will get to know for any partricular transaction how it is behaving when no of users are increasing

Report - Html report if we want to craete report from scenario
High level and detailed report - It will show the worst performing URL amd more memory consuming URLS.Basicaally it has a lot of info
Design studio tab - for correlation

javascript is for browser to check wether password is coorect or not...So we will not record non HTML things bcz it will incresese the response times
We will only focus on server processing time

HTML based recording advance options - 
1) User actions  - it will record all the user actions to different functions..ie.web image,web url,web submit data etc
2) explicit URl only - it will put all the actions into web_url or web_submit _data in case of froms so it will be more radable
 and do not record the non html documents as it is related to browser.
